# Changelog

All notable changes to the Sidekick Agent Hub CLI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.2] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Update notifications**: The dashboard now checks the npm registry for newer versions on startup and shows a yellow banner in the status bar when an update is available (e.g., `v0.13.0 available — npm i -g sidekick-agent-hub`). Results are cached for 24 hours to avoid repeated network requests.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **VS Code integration**: Fixed exit code 127 when the extension launches the CLI dashboard on systems using nvm or volta (node binary not found when shell init is bypassed)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **"Open CLI Dashboard" VS Code Integration**: New VS Code command `Sidekick: Open CLI Dashboard` launches the TUI dashboard in an integrated terminal
  - Install the CLI with `npm install -g sidekick-agent-hub`

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Initial Release**: Full-screen TUI dashboard for monitoring agent sessions from the terminal
  - Ink-based terminal UI with panels for sessions, tasks, kanban, mind map, notes, decisions, search, files, and git diff
  - Multi-provider support: auto-detects Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex sessions
  - Reads from `~/.config/sidekick/` — the same data files the VS Code extension writes
  - Usage: `sidekick dashboard [--project <path>] [--provider <id>]`
