# Quick Start

In a few minutes you'll have inline completions while you code, real-time monitoring when your agent runs, and AI commit messages from your diffs.

After [installing](installation.md) the extension and setting up a [provider](provider-setup.md), you're ready to go.

## Your First Completion

1. Open any code file
2. Start typing — completions appear as ghost text after a brief pause
3. Press **Tab** to accept, **Escape** to dismiss
4. Use `Ctrl+Shift+Space` (`Cmd+Shift+Space` on Mac) to manually trigger a completion

## Try a Code Transform

1. Select some code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+M` (`Cmd+Shift+M` on Mac)
3. Type an instruction like "Add error handling" or "Convert to async/await"
4. The selection is replaced with the transformed code

## Generate a Commit Message

1. Stage your changes in the Source Control panel
2. Click the sparkle icon in the Source Control toolbar
3. A commit message is generated from your diff

## Open the Session Monitor

1. Click the **Agent Hub** icon in the activity bar (left sidebar)
2. The Session Analytics dashboard shows token usage, costs, and activity
3. Below it, the Mind Map and Kanban Board provide additional views

## Key Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Trigger Completion | `Ctrl+Shift+Space` |
| Transform Code | `Ctrl+Shift+M` |
| Generate Docs | `Ctrl+Shift+D` |
| Explain Code | `Ctrl+Shift+E` |
| Quick Ask | `Ctrl+I` |

!!! tip
    Click "Sidekick" in the status bar for quick access to settings, logs, and provider switching.

## CLI Dashboard

If you installed the [CLI](installation.md#cli-terminal-dashboard), you can monitor agent sessions from any terminal:

```bash
sidekick dashboard
```

The dashboard auto-detects your project and provider (Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex). Use number keys **1–6** to switch panels and **Tab** to cycle through detail tabs. You'll see live session activity, token usage, tasks, a mind map, and more.

See [CLI reference](../features/cli.md) for the full command list.
